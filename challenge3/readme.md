#FRC Match Prediction
This command line tool can be used to predict the outcome of a match for this year's Stronghold competition
##What does it do?
This java-based program harnesses current event data from [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs). Using the [JSON in Java](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) library, it parses the JSON objects returned and finds the Calculated Contribution to Winning Margin (CCWM) and the Win/Loss Ratio to accurately determine the probability of an alliance winning.
